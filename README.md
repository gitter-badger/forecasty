# Forecasty


Forecasty is a weather information plugin for e107 v2. It's loosely based on the Android [Fucking Weather](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.karim23697.fuckingweather) app. Rest easy, options to lower the vulgarity of the output will be provided!


# Forecast.io

Forecasty uses Forecast.io's API. In order to use Forecasty you need to register a dev account on the [forecast.io](https://developer.forecast.io/register) developer site and obtain an API token (don't share this with anyone!). You can ignore the "insert billing information" prompt if you don't plan on getting more than 1,000 requests a day. If you do plan on getting more than that it costs $1 for an additional 10,000 requests.
